Physiome Journal Portal (PJP) Prototype Version 1
=================================================

Welcome to the user documentation of Physiome Journal Portal Prototye v1.
This document will give an overview of the components, how users may interact with
each component and the interactions between each component. You may also find API 
Documentation.

Overview
========

The ultimate goal for Physiome Journal Portal (PJP) is to provide a platform for researchers to view and interact with
multiscale physiological models from organism level to molecular level for different
species. Users may view and interact with different organs, view the cells models and even
run simulations. Please note that prototype version 1 of PJP is created to test functionalities and
it is not polished to give the best UI and UX for this time being. UI and UX will be enhanced in 
version 2 and beyond.
